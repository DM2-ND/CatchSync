CatchSync: Catch Synchronized Behavior in Large Directed Graphs (KDD 2014 Best Paper Final List)
Authors: Meng Jiang, Peng Cui, Alex Beutel, Christos Faloutsos and Shiqiang Yang

Given a directed graph with millions of nodes, how can we automatically spot anomalies?
Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications,
from Twitter users who buy fake followers,
manipulating the social network,
to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks,
disturbing the network traffic graph.
 
Input: node pairs (edge list) of a directed graph;
Output:
  1. Feature space plots: in-degree vs. authority for target nodes
                          (out-degree vs. hubness for source nodes);
  2. Synchronicity (coherence) vs. normality: for source nodes.

Installation:
	Python >= 2.6
	R >= 3.0.1

Data: see ./data/socialgraph
	A directed graph (sample data). Two columns {node1,node2}: node1 follows (connects to) node2.
	Injected users: 'badXXXX'; normal users: 'userXXXX'.

Please run "make" in command line.

Result:
	see ./plot/*.png
		followee_feature_space.png: A feature space created by followees' features (in-degree and authority).
		follower_synchronicity_normality.png: Synchronicity vs. Normality for followers. Followers with too
			high synchronicity are suspicious.
